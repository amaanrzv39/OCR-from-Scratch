# OCR from scratch

This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system from scratch using the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) architecture. The CRNN model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling, making it particularly effective for recognizing text in images.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, yet powerful, implementation of OCR that can be trained on custom datasets and used to recognize text in various real-world scenarios.
